# Pallet Detection and Pose Estimation - ROS - Autonomous Pallet Truck with Natural Navigation


- Realsense D435 is used as camera
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros.git

- Yolov3 is used in artificial intelligence training
https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.git

- Darknet is used in connection of artificial intelligence with ROS
https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros.git

- Jsk packages are used to process point cloud data
https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_recognition.git

- ROS navigation is used for natural navigation
https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation.git
  

- Pallet detection and positioning system is included in the robot with additional algorithms developed in addition to these packages.

- With the autonomous pallet truck with recipe management system, the pallet is pick up from the saved place and drop off to the saved place.

- Additionally improved package publishes pallet as box and location as tf.
